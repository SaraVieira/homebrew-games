One day, the blue mage forgot to lock the door and when everyone came back home after a long day, their Princess was gone. A fairy bore terrible news: \"Strange things are happening in the old Demon Fortress atop Pretzel Mountain!\" The four mages did not hesitate.  After chanting a teleportation spell they had just learned at the Academy, they took off to the Demon Fortress.",

We can jump with it and float on the water, but if we touch a solid object, we die. Luckily there are some bells that, when played, store the position where they will appear again. In addition, we can momentarily dive to gain momentum in the jumps. Throughout the game we will improve our bubble with better features.",
